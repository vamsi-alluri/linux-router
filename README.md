# debian-router

Capabilities: NAPT, DHCP, NTP, DNS, CLI Management App

### Instructions to run:
- `make` in the `linux-router/` directory, this will create executable binary file `router` in `/bin` and other object files in `/obj`.
- `./bin/router` starts the router
- - `./bin/router -v` For verbose mode to print debug messages.
 
### Note for using verbose mode: 
Use `print_verbose_ln` to print debug messages.

### DHCP Implementation:
The router includes a full-featured DHCP server with the following capabilities:
- Automatic IP address allocation from configurable subnet (default 192.168.10.0/24)
- Support for all standard DHCP message types (DISCOVER, OFFER, REQUEST, ACK, NAK, RELEASE)
- Lease management with configurable lease time
- Concurrent request handling using multi-threading
- Thread-safe operations with mutex protection

#### DHCP CLI Commands:
- `status` - Shows current DHCP server status including active leases and threads
- `list_leases` - Displays all active DHCP leases with IP, MAC, and expiration time
- `shutdown` - Gracefully terminates the DHCP service

Architecture decided \[Updated over time, add/update as you please.\]:
For the sake of reusing, I'm naming the program that's gonna boot up services as `Router` 

- Router boots up DHCP, NAT, DNS, NTP and CLI. (Not yet sure if we need pipes for NTP.)
- Router program sets up the piping file descriptor for other programs to communicate.
- And it idles (Think if we could detact the processes from Router and end Router program.)

Things to read:
- Multi Threads and processes 
- Piping: for communication

Questions on exception handling:
- What happens if a thread fails, how to handle it?

## Notes from development:
Due to the main router function requirements, the main function of each service exlcuding the router main function must write its pid back to the router main function, so as to both update the router main function that the service has started and to get its pid for accurate shutdown.

If you are planning to add a router specific command that is not in relation to a service, make sure you add it to the help print.
